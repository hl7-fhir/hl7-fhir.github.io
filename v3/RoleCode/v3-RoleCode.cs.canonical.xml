                           Description:Third party administrator (TPA) is a payor organization that processes health care claims without carrying insurance risk. Third party administrators are prominent players in the managed care industry and have the expertise and capability to administer all or a portion of the claims process. They are normally contracted by a health insurer or self-insuring companies to administer services, including claims administration, premium collection, enrollment and other administrative activities.<br/>

                        Self-insured employers often contract with third party administrator to handle their insurance functions. Insurance companies oftentimes outsource the claims, utilization review or membership functions to a TPA. Sometimes TPAs only manage provider networks, only claims or only utilization review.<br/>

                        While some third-party administrators may operate as units of insurance companies, they are often independent. However, hospitals or provider organizations desiring to set up their own health plans will often outsource certain responsibilities to TPAs.  TPAs may perform one or several payor functions, specified by the PayorParticipationFunction value set, such as provider management, enrollment, utilization management, and fee for service claims adjudication management.<br/>

These role.codes may only be used with COVPTY to avoid overlapping concepts that would result from using them to specify the specializations of COVPTY, e.g., the role.class DEPEN should not be used with the role.code family dependent because that relationship has overlapping concepts due to the role.code precoodination and is conveyed in FICO with the personal relationship role that has a PART role link to the covered party role.  For the same reasons, the role.class DEPEN should not be used with the role.code HANDIC (handicapped dependent); the role.code DIFFABLE (differently abled) should be used instead.<br/>

                        In summary, the coded concepts in the Abstract Value Set &quot;CoveredPartyRoleType&quot; can be &quot;post-coordinated&quot; with the &quot;RoleClassCoveredParty&quot; Abstract Value Set.  Decoupling these concepts is intended to support an expansive range of covered party concepts and their semantic comparability.<br/>

These role.codes may only be used with COVPTY to avoid overlapping concepts that would result from using them to specify the specializations of COVPTY, e.g., the role.class DEPEN should not be used with the role.code family dependent because that relationship has overlapping concepts due to the role.code precoodination and is conveyed in FICO with the personal relationship role that has a PART role link to the covered party role.  For the same reasons, the role.class DEPEN should not be used with the role.code HANDIC (handicapped dependent); the role.code DIFFABLE (differently abled) should be used instead.

                        In summary, the coded concepts in the Abstract Value Set &quot;CoveredPartyRoleType&quot; can be &quot;post-coordinated&quot; with the &quot;RoleClassCoveredParty&quot; Abstract Value Set.
