For example, a PQ that is for a true measured amount whose units are not supported in UCUM, a need to convey a REAL when the type has been constrained to INT, etc.<br/>\r\n\n                        With coded datatypes, this null flavor may only be used if the vocabulary binding has a coding strength of CNE.
