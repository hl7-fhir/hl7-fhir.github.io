Examples:
Physically present, over the telephone, written communication.  Rationale:
Particularly for author (originator) participants this is used to specify whether the information represented by the act was initially provided verbally, (hand-)written, or electronically.  Open Issue:
There needs to be a reexamination of the hierarchies as there seems to be some muddling between ELECTRONIC and other concepts that involve electronic communication that are in other hierarchies."/><caseSensitive value="true"/><valueSet value="http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/v3-ParticipationMode"/><hierarchyMeaning value="subsumes"/><content value="complete"/><concept><code value="ELECTRONIC"/><display value="electronic data"/><definition value="Participation by non-human-languaged based electronic signal"/></concept><concept><code value="PHYSICAL"/><display value="physical presence"/><definition value="Participation by direct action where subject and actor are in the same location.
