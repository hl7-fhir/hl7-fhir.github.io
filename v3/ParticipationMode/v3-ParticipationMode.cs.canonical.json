Examples:\r\nPhysically present, over the telephone, written communication.  Rationale:\r\nParticularly for author (originator) participants this is used to specify whether the information represented by the act was initially provided verbally, (hand-)written, or electronically.  Open Issue:\r\nThere needs to be a reexamination of the hierarchies as there seems to be some muddling between ELECTRONIC and other concepts that involve electronic communication that are in other hierarchies.","experimental":false,"hierarchyMeaning":"subsumes","id":"v3-ParticipationMode","identifier":{"system":"urn:ietf:rfc:3986","value":"urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.5.1064"},"meta":{"lastUpdated":"2016-03-23T00:00:00.000+00:00"},"name":"v3 Code System ParticipationMode","publisher":"HL7, Inc","resourceType":"CodeSystem","status":"active","text":{"div":"<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Release Date: 2016-03-23</p>\r\n<table class=\"grid\">\r\n <tr><td><b>Level</b></td><td><b>Code</b></td><td><b>Display</b></td><td><b>Definition</b></td></tr>\r\n <tr><td>1</td><td>ELECTRONIC<a name=\"ELECTRONIC\"> </a></td><td>electronic data</td><td>\n                        Participation by non-human-languaged based electronic signal<br/>\r\n\n                     </td></tr>\r\n <tr><td>1</td><td>PHYSICAL<a name=\"PHYSICAL\"> </a></td><td>physical presence</td><td>\n                        Participation by direct action where subject and actor are in the same location.
