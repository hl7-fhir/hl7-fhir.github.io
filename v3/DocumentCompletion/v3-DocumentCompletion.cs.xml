                        A completion status in which a document has been signed manually or electronically by one or more individuals who attest to its accuracy.  No explicit determination is made that the assigned individual has performed the authentication.  While the standard allows multiple instances of authentication, it would be typical to have a single instance of authentication, usually by the assigned individual.
