                        In some organ transplantation services and rarely in transfusion services a donor will be a target participant in the service.  However, in most cases transplantation is decomposed in three services: explantation, transport, and implantation.  The identity of the donor (recipient) is often irrelevant for the explantation (implantation) service.

                        Target on behalf of whom the service happens, but that is not necessarily present in the service.  Can occur together with direct target to indicate that a target is both, as in the case where the patient is the indirect beneficiary of a service rendered to a family member, e.g. counseling or given home care instructions.  This concept includes a participant, such as a covered party, who derives benefits from a service act covered by a coverage act.

                        Note that the semantic role of the intended recipient who benefits from the happening denoted by the verb in the clause.  Thus, a patient who has no coverage under a policy or program may be a beneficiary of a health service while not being the beneficiary of coverage for that service.
