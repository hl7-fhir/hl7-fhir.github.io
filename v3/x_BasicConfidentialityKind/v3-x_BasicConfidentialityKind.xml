        <p>Description:
Used to enumerate the typical confidentiality constraints placed upon a clinical document.  Usage Note:
x_BasicConfidentialityKind is a subset of Confidentiality codes that are used as metadata indicating the receiver responsibility to comply with normally applicable jurisdictional privacy law or disclosure authorization; that the receiver may not disclose this information except as directed by the information custodian, who may be the information subject; or that the receiver may not disclose this information except as directed by the information custodian, who may be the information subject.</p>

      <p>This value set includes codes from the following code systems:</p>

                <br/>
                        
                           Examples: In the US, this includes what HIPAA identifies as the minimum necessary protected health information (PHI) given a covered purpose of use (treatment, payment, or operations).  Includes typical, non-stigmatizing health information disclosed in an application for health, workers compensation, disability, or life insurance.

                           Map: Partial Map to ISO 13606-4 Sensitivity Level (3) Clinical Care:   Default for normal clinical care access (i.e. most clinical staff directly caring for the patient should be able to access nearly all of the EHR).   Maps to normal confidentiality for treatment information but not to ancillary care, payment and operations.

                           Usage Note: This metadata indicates that the receiver may be obligated to comply with applicable jurisdictional privacy law or disclosure authorization.

              <td>Privacy metadata indicating highly sensitive, potentially stigmatizing information, which presents a high risk to the information subject if disclosed without authorization. May be pre-empted by jurisdictional law, e.g., for public health reporting or emergency treatment.
                <br/>
                        
                           Examples: Includes information that is additionally protected such as sensitive conditions mental health, HIV, substance abuse, domestic violence, child abuse, genetic disease, and reproductive health; or sensitive demographic information such as a patient&#39;s standing as an employee or a celebrity. May be used to indicate proprietary or classified information that is not related to an individual, e.g., secret ingredients in a therapeutic substance; or the name of a manufacturer.

                           Examples:  Includes information about a victim of abuse, patient requested information sensitivity, and taboo subjects relating to health status that must be discussed with the patient by an attending provider before sharing with the patient.
