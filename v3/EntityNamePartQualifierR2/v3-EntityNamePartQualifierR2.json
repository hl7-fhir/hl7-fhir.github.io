This qualifier may be used to explicitly indicate which given names are considered to be middle names. The middle name qualifier may also be used with family names. This is a Scandinavian use case, matching the concept of &quot;mellomnavn&quot;,&quot;mellannamn&quot;. Note that there are specific rules that indicate what names may be taken as a mellannamn in different Scandinavian countries. \t\t\t\t   <br/>\r\n\n                     </td></tr>\r\n <tr><td>1</td><td>PFX<a name=\"PFX\"> </a></td><td>prefix</td><td>\n                        \n                           Description:A prefix has a strong association to the immediately following name part.
