                      &quot;definition&quot;: &quot;Definition: A request act that is specialized for an event request/fulfillment cycle. \r\n\n                        \n                           UsageNotes: The fulfillment cycle may involve intermediary fulfilling acts in moods such as PRMS, APT, or even another RQO before being fulfilled by the final event. \r\n\n                        \n                           UsageNotes: The concepts of a \&quot;request\&quot; and an \&quot;order\&quot; are viewed as different, because there is an implication of a mandate associated with order.  In practice, however, this distinction has no general functional value in the inter-operation of health care computing.  \&quot;Orders\&quot; are commonly refused for a variety of clinical and business reasons, and the notion of a \&quot;request\&quot; obligates the recipient (the fulfiller) to respond to the sender (the author).  Indeed, in many regions, including Australia and Europe, the common term used is \&quot;request.\&quot;\r\n\n                        Thus, the concept embodies both notions, as there is no useful distinction to be made.  If a mandate is to be associated with a request, this will be embodied in the \&quot;local\&quot; business rules applied to the transactions.  Should HL7 desire to provide a distinction between these in the future, the individual concepts could be added as specializations of this concept.\r\n\n                        The critical distinction here, is the difference between this concept and an \&quot;intent\&quot;, of which it is a specialization.  An intent involves decisions by a single party, the author.  A request, however, involves decisions by two parties, the author and the fulfiller, with an obligation on the part of the fulfiller to respond to the request indicating that the fulfiller will indeed fulfill the request.&quot;

This contrasts with goal which doesn't represent an intention to act, merely a hope for an eventual result.  A goal is distinct from the intended actions to reach that goal.  \&quot;I will reduce the dose of drug x to 20mg\&quot; is an intent.  \&quot;I hope to be able to get the patient to the point where I can reduce the dose of drug x to 20mg\&quot; is a goal.

A risk factor that is present (e.g. obesity, smoking, etc) should be expressed in event mood. INT (intent) reflects a plan for the future, which is a declaration to do something. This contrasts with RSK (risk), which is the potential that something negative will occur that may or may not ever happen. GOL (goal) reflects a hope to achieve something. EXPEC (expectation) is the prediction of a positive or negative event. This contrasts with RSK (risk), which is the potential that something negative will occur that may or may not ever happen, and may not be expected to happen.&quot;

Typically used in definitions or orders to describe alternatives. An option can only be used as a group, that is, all assigned values must be used together. The actual mood of the act is the same as the parent act, and they must be linked by an actrelationship with type = OPTN.&quot;
