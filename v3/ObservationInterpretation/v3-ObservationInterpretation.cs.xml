                              Deprecation Comment: 
                           This code is currently the same string as the print name for this concept and is inconsistent with the conventions being used for the other codes in the coding system, as it is a full word with initial capitalization, rather than an all upper case mnemonic.  The recommendation from OO is to deprecate the code &quot;Carrier&quot; and to add &quot;CAR&quot; as the new active code representation for this concept.

                        A category used for isolates for which only a susceptible interpretive criterion has been designated because of the absence or rare occurrence of resistant strains. Isolates that have MICs above or zone diameters below the value indicated for the susceptible breakpoint should be reported as non-susceptible.
            <br/>

                        NOTE 1: An isolate that is interpreted as non-susceptible does not necessarily mean that the isolate has a resistance mechanism. It is possible that isolates with MICs above the susceptible breakpoint that lack resistance mechanisms may be encountered within the wild-type distribution subsequent to the time the susceptible-only breakpoint is set. 
            <br/>

                        NOTE 2: For strains yielding results in the &quot;nonsusceptible&quot; category, organism identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test results should be confirmed.

The only apparent significant difference is their reference to use in protocols for exclusion of study subjects.
These concepts/codes were proposed by RCRIM for use in the CTLaboratory message.  They were submitted and approved in the November 2005 Harmonization cycle in proposal &quot;030103C_VOCAB_RCRIM_l_quade_RCRIM Obs Interp_20051028154455&quot;.  However, this proposal was not fully implemented in the vocabulary.  The proposal recommended creation of the x_ClinicalResearchExclusion domain in ObservationInterpretation with a value set including those three concepts/codes, but there is no subdomain of that name or equivalent with a binding to either of the value sets that contain these concepts/codes.
Members of the OO WG have recently attempted to contact members of RCRIM regarding these concepts, both by email and at the recent WGM in Atlanta, without response.  It is felt by OO that the best course of action to take at this time is to add this comprehensive Open Issue rather than deprecate these three concepts at this time, until further discussion is held.

                              Deprecation Comment: 
                           This code is currently the same string as the print name for this concept and is inconsistent with the conventions being used for the other codes in the coding system, as it is a full word with initial capitalization, rather than an all upper case mnemonic.  The recommendation from OO is to deprecate the code &quot;Carrier&quot; and to add &quot;CAR&quot; as the new active code representation for this concept."/>

It is possible that isolates with MICs above the susceptible breakpoint that lack resistance mechanisms may be encountered within the wild-type distribution subsequent to the time the susceptible-only breakpoint is set. 

                        NOTE 2: For strains yielding results in the &quot;nonsusceptible&quot; category, organism identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test results should be confirmed.
