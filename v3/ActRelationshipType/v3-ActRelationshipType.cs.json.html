A reason link is weaker than a trigger, it only suggests that some service may be or might have been a reason for some action, but not that this reason requires/required the action to be taken. Also, as opposed to the trigger, there is no strong timely relation between the reason and the action.  As well as providing various types of information about the rationale for a service, the RSON act relationship is routinely used between a SBADM act and an OBS act to describe the indication for use of a medication.  Child concepts may be used to describe types of indication. \r\n\n                        \n                           Discussion: In prior releases, the code \&quot;SUGG\&quot; (suggests) was expressed as \&quot;an inversion of the reason link.\&quot; That code has been retired in favor of the inversion indicator that is an attribute of ActRelationship.&quot;,

Conversely, if a ROI simply contains ST elevation, but it does not define the bounds (start and end) of the episode, the more general \&quot;has support\&quot; relation is used.  Likewise, if a ROI on an image defines the true bounds of a \&quot;1st degree burn\&quot;, the relation \&quot;has bounded support\&quot; is used; but if the ROI only points to the approximate area of the burn, the general \&quot;has support\&quot; relation is used.&quot;
