Both, source and target can be any kind of service; target service is in criterion mood. How the strength of a contraindication is expressed (e.g., relative, absolute) is left as an open issue. The priorityNumber attribute could be used.</td></tr><tr><td><a name="http---hl7.org-fhir-v3-ActRelationshipType-PRCN"> </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="../../v3/ActRelationshipType/cs.html#v3-ActRelationshipType-PRCN">PRCN</a></td><td>has pre-condition</td><td>A requirement to be true before a service is performed.

A reason link is weaker than a trigger, it only suggests that some service may be or might have been a reason for some action, but not that this reason requires/required the action to be taken. Also, as opposed to the trigger, there is no strong timely relation between the reason and the action.  As well as providing various types of information about the rationale for a service, the RSON act relationship is routinely used between a SBADM act and an OBS act to describe the indication for use of a medication.  Child concepts may be used to describe types of indication. 

                        
                           Discussion: In prior releases, the code &quot;SUGG&quot; (suggests) was expressed as &quot;an inversion of the reason link.&quot; That code has been retired in favor of the inversion indicator that is an attribute of ActRelationship.</td></tr><tr><td><a name="http---hl7.org-fhir-v3-ActRelationshipType-BLOCK"> </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="../../v3/ActRelationshipType/cs.html#v3-ActRelationshipType-BLOCK">BLOCK</a></td><td>blocks</td><td>Definition: The source act is performed to block the effects of the target act.

                           Discussion: This includes the concept of a  required act for a service or financial instrument such as an insurance plan or policy. In such cases, the trigger is the occurrence of a specific condition such as coverage limits being exceeded.</td></tr><tr><td><a name="http---hl7.org-fhir-v3-ActRelationshipType--ActRelationshipTemporallyPertains"> </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="../../v3/ActRelationshipType/cs.html#v3-ActRelationshipType-_ActRelationshipTemporallyPertains">_ActRelationshipTemporallyPertains</a></td><td>ActRelationshipTemporallyPertains</td><td>Abstract collector for ActRelationhsip types that relate two acts by their timing.</td></tr><tr><td><a name="http---hl7.org-fhir-v3-ActRelationshipType--ActRelationshipTemporallyPertainsApproximates"> </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="../../v3/ActRelationshipType/cs.html#v3-ActRelationshipType-_ActRelationshipTemporallyPertainsApproximates">_ActRelationshipTemporallyPertainsApproximates</a></td><td>ActRelationshipTemporallyPertainsApproximates</td><td>Abstract collector for ActRelationship types that relate two acts by their approximate timing.</td></tr><tr><td><a name="http---hl7.org-fhir-v3-ActRelationshipType-ENE"> </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="../../v3/ActRelationshipType/cs.html#v3-ActRelationshipType-ENE">ENE</a></td><td>ends near end</td><td>A relationship in which the source act's effective time ends near the end of the target act's effective time.

Conversely, if a ROI simply contains ST elevation, but it does not define the bounds (start and end) of the episode, the more general &quot;has support&quot; relation is used.  Likewise, if a ROI on an image defines the true bounds of a &quot;1st degree burn&quot;, the relation &quot;has bounded support&quot; is used; but if the ROI only points to the approximate area of the burn, the general &quot;has support&quot; relation is used.</td></tr><tr><td><a name="http---hl7.org-fhir-v3-ActRelationshipType-SUBJ"> </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="../../v3/ActRelationshipType/cs.html#v3-ActRelationshipType-SUBJ">SUBJ</a></td><td>has subject</td><td>Relates an Act to its subject Act that the first Act is primarily concerned with.

                              The first act is a region of interest (ROI) that defines a region within the subject Act.

                        Constraints

                        An Act may have multiple subject acts.

                        Rationale

                        The ActRelationshipType &quot;has subject&quot; is similar to the ParticipationType &quot;subject&quot;, Acts that primarily operate on physical subjects use the Participation, those Acts that primarily operate on other Acts (other information) use the ActRelationship.</td></tr><tr><td><a name="http---hl7.org-fhir-v3-ActRelationshipType-QUALF"> </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="../../v3/ActRelationshipType/cs.html#v3-ActRelationshipType-QUALF">QUALF</a></td><td>has qualifier</td><td>The target observation qualifies (refines) the semantics of the source observation.

                        
                           UsageNote: This is not intended to replace concept refinement and qualification via vocabulary.  It is used when there are multiple components which together provide the complete understanding of the source Act.</td></tr><tr><td><a name="http---hl7.org-fhir-v3-ActRelationshipType-SUMM"> </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="../../v3/ActRelationshipType/cs.html#v3-ActRelationshipType-SUMM">SUMM</a></td><td>summarized by</td><td>An act that contains summary values for a list or set of subordinate acts.

                           FormalConstraint: Source Act must be an Observation or specialization there-of. Source Act must not have the value attribute specified

                        
                           UsageNote: This relationship allows the result of an observation to be fully expressed as RIM acts as opposed to being embedded in the value attribute.  For example, sending a Document act as the result of an imaging observation, sending a list of Procedures and/or other acts as the result of a medical history observation.

                        The valueNegationInd attribute on the source Act has the same semantics of &quot;negated finding&quot; when it applies to the target of a VALUE ActRelationship as it does to the value attribute.  On the other hand, if the ActRelationship.negationInd is true for a VALUE ActRelationship, that means the specified observation does not have the indicated value but does not imply a negated finding.  Because the semantics are extremely close, it is recommended that Observation.valueNegationInd be used, not ActRelationship.negationInd.
