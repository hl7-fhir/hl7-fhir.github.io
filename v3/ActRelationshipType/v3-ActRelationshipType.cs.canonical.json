On the other hand, if the ActRelationship.negationInd is true for a VALUE ActRelationship, that means the specified observation does not have the indicated value but does not imply a negated finding.  Because the semantics are extremely close, it is recommended that Observation.valueNegationInd be used, not ActRelationship.negationInd.\r\n\n                        \n                           OpenIssue: The implications of negationInd on ActRelationship and the valueNegationind on Observation.","display":"has value"}],"definition":"Description: A directed association between a source Act and a target Act.\r\n\n                        \n                           Usage Note: This code should never be transmitted in an instance as the value of ActRelationship.typeCode (attribute)","display":"act relationship type"},{"code":"CURE","definition":"curative indication","display":"curative indication","property":[{"code":"notSelectable","valueBoolean":true}]},{"code":"CURE.ADJ","definition":"adjunct curative indication","display":"adjunct curative indication","property":[{"code":"notSelectable","valueBoolean":true}]},{"code":"MTGT.ADJ","definition":"adjunct mitigation","display":"adjunct mitigation","property":[{"code":"notSelectable","valueBoolean":true}]},{"code":"RACT","property":[{"code":"notSelectable","valueBoolean":true}]},{"code":"SUGG","property":[{"code":"notSelectable","valueBoolean":true}]}],"contact":[{"telecom":[{"system":"other","value":"http://hl7.org"}]}],"content":"complete","date":"2016-03-23T00:00:00+00:00","description":" The source is an excerpt from the target.","experimental":false,"hierarchyMeaning":"subsumes","id":"v3-ActRelationshipType","identifier":{"system":"urn:ietf:rfc:3986","value":"urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.5.1002"},"meta":{"lastUpdated":"2016-03-23T00:00:00.000+00:00"},"name":"v3 Code System ActRelationshipType","property":[{"code":"notSelectable","description":"Indicates that the code is abstract - only intended to be used as a selector for other concepts","type":"boolean","uri":"http://hl7.org/fhir/concept-properties#notSelectable"},{"code":"inactive","description":"True if the concept is not considered active - e.g. not a valid concept any more","type":"boolean","uri":"http://hl7.org/fhir/concept-properties#inactive"}],"publisher":"HL7, Inc","resourceType":"CodeSystem","status":"active","text":{"div":"<div xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><p>Release Date: 2016-03-23</p>\r\n<table class=\"grid\">\r\n <tr><td><b>Level</b></td><td><b>Code</b></td><td><b>Display</b></td><td><b>Definition</b></td></tr>\r\n <tr><td>1</td><td>ART<a name=\"ART\"> </a></td><td>act relationship type</td><td>\n                        \n                           Description: A directed association between a source Act and a target Act.<br/>\r\n\n                        \n                           Usage Note: This code should never be transmitted in an instance as the value of ActRelationship.typeCode (attribute)<br/>\r\n\n                     </td></tr>\r\n <tr><td>2</td><td>  <span style=\"color: grey\"><i>(_ActClassTemporallyPertains)</i></span> <b><i>Abstract</i></b></td><td><a name=\"_ActClassTemporallyPertains\"> </a></td><td/></tr>\r\n <tr><td>2</td><td>  <span style=\"color: grey\"><i>(_ActRelationshipAccounting)</i></span> <b><i>Abstract</i></b></td><td><a name=\"_ActRelationshipAccounting\"> </a></td><td>\n                        Codes that describe the relationship between an Act and a financial instrument such as a financial transaction, account or invoice element.<br/>\r\n\n                     </td></tr>\r\n <tr><td>3</td><td>    <span style=\"color: grey\"><i>(_ActRelationshipCostTracking)</i></span> <b><i>Abstract</i></b></td><td><a name=\"_ActRelationshipCostTracking\"> </a></td><td>\n                        Expresses values for describing the relationship relationship between an InvoiceElement or InvoiceElementGroup and a billable act.<br/>\r\n\n                     </td></tr>\r\n <tr><td>4</td><td>      CHRG<a name=\"CHRG\"> </a></td><td>has charge</td><td>\n                        A relationship that provides an ability to associate a financial transaction (target) as a charge to a clinical act (source).

For example, if the start and end of an ST elevation episode is visible in an EKG, this relation would indicate the ROI bounds the  &quot;ST elevation&quot; observation -- the ROI defines the true beginning and ending of the episode.  Conversely, if a ROI simply contains ST elevation, but it does not define the bounds (start and end) of the episode, the more general &quot;has support&quot; relation is used.  Likewise, if a ROI on an image defines the true bounds of a &quot;1st degree burn&quot;, the relation &quot;has bounded support&quot; is used; but if the ROI only points to the approximate area of the burn, the general &quot;has support&quot; relation is used.<br/>\r\n\n                     </td></tr>\r\n <tr><td>2</td><td>  SUBJ<a name=\"SUBJ\"> </a></td><td>has subject</td><td>\n                        Relates an Act to its subject Act that the first Act is primarily concerned with.<br/>\r\n\n                        Examples<br/>\r\n\n                        \n                           \n                              The first Act may be a ControlAct manipulating the subject Act <br/>\r\n\n                           \n                           \n                              The first act is a region of interest (ROI) that defines a region within the subject Act.<br/>\r\n\n                           \n                           \n                              The first act is a reporting or notification Act, that echos the subject Act for a specific new purpose.<br/>\r\n\n                           \n                        \n                        Constraints<br/>\r\n\n                        An Act may have multiple subject acts.<br/>\r\n\n                        Rationale<br/>\r\n\n                        The ActRelationshipType &quot;has subject&quot; is similar to the ParticipationType &quot;subject&quot;, Acts that primarily operate on physical subjects use the Participation, those Acts that primarily operate on other Acts (other information) use the ActRelationship.<br/>\r\n\n                     </td></tr>\r\n <tr><td>3</td><td>    QUALF<a name=\"QUALF\"> </a></td><td>has qualifier</td><td>\n                        The target observation qualifies (refines) the semantics of the source observation.<br/>\r\n\n                        \n                           UsageNote: This is not intended to replace concept refinement and qualification via vocabulary.
