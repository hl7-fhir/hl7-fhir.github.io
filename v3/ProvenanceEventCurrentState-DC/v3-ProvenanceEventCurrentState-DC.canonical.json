No explicit determination is made that the assigned individual has performed the authentication.

Examples include paper documents, whether hand-written or typewritten, and intermediate electronic forms, such as voice to text.</td></tr><tr><td>LA</td><td>legally authenticated</td><td>A completion status in which a document has been signed manually or electronically by the individual who is legally responsible for that document.
