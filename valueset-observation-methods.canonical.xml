			<p>This value sets refers to 3 different sources of observation method codes, each with issues:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>SNOMED CT Techniques (descendants of 272394005): As for August 2015, this is relatively complete (e.g. includes all LOINC methods). However this includes more than just observation methods, and is subject to the normal SNOMED CT licensing rules</li>
				<li>v3 Code System &quot;ObservationMethod&quot;: this is very incomplete and not currently maintained</li>
			</ul>
