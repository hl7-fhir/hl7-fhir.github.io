The original document shall be referenced via an attribute in the new document, which contains, for example, the digest of the old document.

          <td>the signature on an original document of an individual who has generated a new amended document.

This is the inverse of an addendum signature and provides a pointer from the original to the amended document.</td>

          <td>Administrative (Error/Edit) Signature</td>
          <td>the signature of an individual who is certifying that the document is invalidated by an error(s), or is placed in the wrong chart. An administrative (error/edit) signature must include an addendum to the document and therefore shall have an addendum signature sub-type (see 8.1). This signature is reserved for the highest health information system administrative classification, since it is a statement that the entire document is invalidated by the error and that the document should no longer be used for patient care, although for legal reasons the document must remain part of the permanent patient record.</td>
