The use of extensions is what allows the FHIR specification to retain a core level of simplicity for everyone.","type":"display"}],"linkId":"CodeSystem.concept.property.modifierExtension","repeats":true,"required":false,"text":"Extensions that cannot be ignored","type":"group"},{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-minOccurs","valueInteger":1},{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-maxOccurs","valueInteger":1},{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-fhirType","valueString":"code"}],"item":[{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-itemControl","valueCodeableConcept":{"coding":[{"code":"flyover","display":"Fly-over","system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire-item-control"}]}}],"text":"A code that is a reference to CodeSystem.property.code.","type":"display"},{"linkId":"CodeSystem.concept.property.code.value","repeats":false,"required":false,"text":"code","type":"choice"}],"linkId":"CodeSystem.concept.property.code","repeats":true,"required":true,"type":"group"},{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-minOccurs","valueInteger":1},{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-maxOccurs","valueInteger":1}],"item":[{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-itemControl","valueCodeableConcept":{"coding":[{"code":"flyover","display":"Fly-over","system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire-item-control"}]}}],"text":"The value of this property.","type":"display"},{"item":[{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-fhirType","valueString":"code"}],"item":[{"linkId":"CodeSystem.concept.property.value[x]._code.value","repeats":false,"required":false,"text":"value[x]","type":"choice"}],"linkId":"CodeSystem.concept.property.value[x]._code","type":"group"},{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-fhirType","valueString":"Coding"}],"item":[{"linkId":"CodeSystem.concept.property.value[x]._Coding.value","repeats":false,"required":false,"text":"Coding","type":"open-choice"}],"linkId":"CodeSystem.concept.property.value[x]._Coding","type":"group"},{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-fhirType","valueString":"string"}],"item":[{"linkId":"CodeSystem.concept.property.value[x]._string.value","repeats":false,"required":false,"text":"string","type":"string"}],"linkId":"CodeSystem.concept.property.value[x]._string","type":"group"},{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-fhirType","valueString":"integer"}],"item":[{"linkId":"CodeSystem.concept.property.value[x]._integer.value","repeats":false,"required":false,"text":"integer","type":"integer"}],"linkId":"CodeSystem.concept.property.value[x]._integer","type":"group"},{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-fhirType","valueString":"boolean"}],"item":[{"linkId":"CodeSystem.concept.property.value[x]._boolean.value","repeats":false,"required":false,"text":"boolean","type":"boolean"}],"linkId":"CodeSystem.concept.property.value[x]._boolean","type":"group"},{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-fhirType","valueString":"datetime"}],"item":[{"linkId":"CodeSystem.concept.property.value[x]._dateTime.value","repeats":false,"required":false,"text":"dateTime","type":"dateTime"}],"linkId":"CodeSystem.concept.property.value[x]._dateTime","type":"group"}],"linkId":"CodeSystem.concept.property.value[x]._type","options":{"reference":"#vs2"},"repeats":false,"required":false,"text":"type","type":"choice"}],"linkId":"CodeSystem.concept.property.value[x]","repeats":true,"required":true,"text":"Value of the property for this concept","type":"group"}],"linkId":"CodeSystem.concept.property","repeats":true,"required":false,"text":"Property value for the concept","type":"group"},{"item":[{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-itemControl","valueCodeableConcept":{"coding":[{"code":"flyover","display":"Fly-over","system":"http://hl7.org/fhir/questionnaire-item-control"}]}}],"text":"Defines children of a concept to produce a hierarchy of concepts.
