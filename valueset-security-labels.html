                           Examples: In the US, this includes what HIPAA identifies as the minimum necessary protected health information (PHI) given a covered purpose of use (treatment, payment, or operations).  Includes typical, non-stigmatizing health information disclosed in an application for health, workers compensation, disability, or life insurance.

                           Examples: Includes information that is additionally protected such as sensitive conditions mental health, HIV, substance abuse, domestic violence, child abuse, genetic disease, and reproductive health; or sensitive demographic information such as a patient's standing as an employee or a celebrity. May be used to indicate proprietary or classified information that is not related to an individual, e.g., secret ingredients in a therapeutic substance; or the name of a manufacturer.

                           Examples:  Includes information about a victim of abuse, patient requested information sensitivity, and taboo subjects relating to health status that must be discussed with the patient by an attending provider before sharing with the patient.  May also include information held under â€œlegal lockâ€? or attorney-client privilege

                        
                           Map:  This metadata indicates that the receiver may not disclose this information except as directed by the information custodian, who may be the information subject.

                        
                           Usage Note:  This metadata indicates that the receiver may not disclose this information except as directed by the information custodian, who may be the information subject.</td></tr><tr><td><a name="http---hl7.org-fhir-v3-ActCode--InformationSensitivityPolicy"> </a><a href="v3/ActCode/cs.html#v3-ActCode-_InformationSensitivityPolicy">_InformationSensitivityPolicy</a></td><td>http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ActCode</td><td>InformationSensitivityPolicy</td><td>A mandate, obligation, requirement, rule, or expectation characterizing the value or importance of a resource and may include its vulnerability. (Based on ISO7498-2:1989. Note: The vulnerability of personally identifiable sensitive information may be based on concerns that the unauthorized disclosure may result in social stigmatization or discrimination.) Description:  Types of Sensitivity policy that apply to Acts or Roles.  A sensitivity policy is adopted by an enterprise or group of enterprises (a 'policy domain') through a formal data use agreement that stipulates the value, importance, and vulnerability of information. A sensitivity code representing a sensitivity policy may be associated with criteria such as categories of information or sets of information identifiers (e.g., a value set of clinical codes or branch in a code system hierarchy).   These criteria may in turn be used for the Policy Decision Point in a Security Engine.  A sensitivity code may be used to set the confidentiality code used on information about Acts and Roles to trigger the security mechanisms required to control how security principals (i.e., a person, a machine, a software application) may act on the information (e.g., collection, access, use, or disclosure). Sensitivity codes are never assigned to the transport or business envelope containing patient specific information being exchanged outside of a policy domain as this would disclose the information intended to be protected by the policy.  When sensitive information is exchanged with others outside of a policy domain, the confidentiality code on the transport or business envelope conveys the receiver's responsibilities and indicates the how the information is to be safeguarded without unauthorized disclosure of the sensitive information.  This ensures that sensitive information is treated by receivers as the sender intends, accomplishing interoperability without point to point negotiations.

                        
                           Usage Note: Sensitivity codes are not useful for interoperability outside of a policy domain because sensitivity policies are typically localized and vary drastically across policy domains even for the same information category because of differing organizational business rules, security policies, and jurisdictional requirements.  For example, an employee's sensitivity code would make little sense for use outside of a policy domain.   'Taboo' would rarely be useful outside of a policy domain unless there are jurisdictional requirements requiring that a provider disclose sensitive information to a patient directly.  Sensitivity codes may be more appropriate in a legacy system's Master Files in order to notify those who access a patient's orders and observations about the sensitivity policies that apply.  Newer systems may have a security engine that uses a sensitivity policy's criteria directly.  The specializable InformationSensitivityPolicy Act.code may be useful in some scenarios if used in combination with a sensitivity identifier and/or Act.title.</td></tr><tr><td><a name="http---hl7.org-fhir-v3-ActCode--ActInformationSensitivityPolicy"> </a><a href="v3/ActCode/cs.html#v3-ActCode-_ActInformationSensitivityPolicy">_ActInformationSensitivityPolicy</a></td><td>http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ActCode</td><td>ActInformationSensitivityPolicy</td><td>Types of sensitivity policies that apply to Acts.  Act.confidentialityCode is defined in the RIM as &quot;constraints around appropriate disclosure of information about this Act, regardless of mood.&quot;

                        
                           Usage Note: ActSensitivity codes are used to bind information to an Act.confidentialityCode according to local sensitivity policy so that those confidentiality codes can then govern its handling across enterprises.  Internally to a policy domain, however, local policies guide the access control system on how end users in that policy domain are  able to use information tagged with these sensitivity values.</td></tr><tr><td><a name="http---hl7.org-fhir-v3-ActCode-ETH"> </a><a href="v3/ActCode/cs.html#v3-ActCode-ETH">ETH</a></td><td>http://hl7.org/fhir/v3/ActCode</td><td>substance abuse information sensitivity</td><td>Policy for handling alcohol or drug-abuse information, which will be afforded heightened confidentiality.
