This element has a variable name depending on the type as follows: valueQuantity, valueCodeableConcept, valueString, valueRange, valueRatio, valueSampledData, valueAttachment, valueTime, valueDateTime, or valuePeriod. (The name format is \"'value' + the type name\" with a capital on the first letter of the type).\r\r\rIf the data element is usually coded or if the type associated with the Observation.value defines a coded value, use CodeableConcept instead of string datatype even if the value is uncoded text.  A value set is bound to the ValueCodeableConcept element.  For boolean values use valueCodeableConcept and select codes from [HL7 Version 2 Table 0136](v2/0136/index.html).

A few observations (e.g. Apgar score) may have both a value and related observations (for an Apgar score, the observations from which the measure is derived). If a value is present, the datatype for this element should be determined by Observation.code. A CodeableConcept with just a text would be used instead of a string if the field was usually coded, or if the type associated with the Observation.code defines a coded value.   For boolean values use valueCodeableConcept and select codes from <http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/v2-0136> (These \"yes/no\" concepts can be mapped to the display name \"true/false\" or other mutually exclusive terms that may be needed\").  The element, Observation.value[x], has a variable name depending on the type as follows: valueQuantity, valueCodeableConcept, valueRatio, valueChoice, valuePeriod, valueSampleData, or valueString (The name format is \"'value' + the type name\" with a capital on the first letter of the type).",

The alternate way is to use the value element for actual observations and use the explicit dataAbsentReason element to record exceptional values.

One way is to simply include them in the value set and represent the exceptions in the value.  For example, measurement values for a serology test could be  \"detected\", \"not detected\", \"inconclusive\", or  \"test not done\".   The alternate way is to use the value element for actual observations and use the explicit dataAbsentReason element to record exceptional values.  For example, the dataAbsentReason code \"error\" could be used when the measurement was not completed.
