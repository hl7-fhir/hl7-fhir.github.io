        &quot;definition&quot;: &quot;Identification of the underlying physiological mechanism for the reaction risk.&quot;,
        &quot;comments&quot;: &quot;Allergic (typically immune-mediated) reactions have been traditionally regarded as an indicator for potential escalation to significant future risk. Contemporary knowledge suggests that some reactions previously thought to be immune-mediated are, in fact, non-immune, but in some cases can still pose a life threatening risk. It is acknowledged that many clinicians may not be in a position to distinguish the mechanism of a particular reaction. Often the term \&quot;allergy\&quot; is used rather generically and may overlap with the use of \&quot;intolerance\&quot; - in practice the boundaries between these two concepts may not be well-defined or understood. This data element is included nevertheless, because many legacy systems have captured this attribute. Immunologic testing may provide supporting evidence for the basis of the reaction and the causative substance, but no tests are 100% sensitive or specific for sensitivity to a particular substance. If, as is commonly the case, it is unclear whether the reaction is due to an allergy or an intolerance, then the type element should be omitted from the resource.&quot;,

Additional details can be specified in the text.\r\rWhen a substance or product code is specified for the 'code' element, the \&quot;default\&quot; semantic context is that this is a positive statement of an allergy or intolerance (depending on the value of the 'type' element, if present) condition to the specified substance/product.  In the corresponding SNOMED CT allergy model, the specified substance/product is the target (destination) of the \&quot;Causative agent\&quot; relationship.\r\rThe 'substanceExposureRisk' extension is available as a structured and more flexible alternative to the 'code' element for making positive or negative allergy or intolerance statements.  This extension provides the capability to make \&quot;no known allergy\&quot; (or \&quot;no risk of adverse reaction\&quot;) statements regarding any coded substance/product (including cases when a pre-coordinated \&quot;no allergy to x\&quot; concept for that substance/product does not exist).

The 'code' element allows for the use of a specific substance or pharmaceutical product, or a group or class of substances. In the case of an allergy or intolerance to a class of substances, (for example, \&quot;penicillins\&quot;), the 'reaction.substance' element could be used to code the specific substance that was identifed as having caused the reaction (for example, \&quot;amoxycillin\&quot;). Duplication of the value in the 'code' and 'reaction.substance' elements is acceptable when a specific substance has been recorded in 'code'.&quot;,

        &quot;comments&quot;: &quot;Allergic (typically immune-mediated) reactions have been traditionally regarded as an indicator for potential escalation to significant future risk. Contemporary knowledge suggests that some reactions previously thought to be immune-mediated are, in fact, non-immune, but in some cases can still pose a life threatening risk. It is acknowledged that many clinicians may not be in a position to distinguish the mechanism of a particular reaction. Often the term \&quot;allergy\&quot; is used rather generically and may overlap with the use of \&quot;intolerance\&quot; - in practice the boundaries between these two concepts may not be well-defined or understood. This data element is included nevertheless, because many legacy systems have captured this attribute. Immunologic testing may provide supporting evidence for the basis of the reaction and the causative substance, but no tests are 100% sensitive or specific for sensitivity to a particular substance. If, as is commonly the case, it is unclear whether the reaction is due to an allergy or an intolerance, then the type element should be omitted from the resource.&quot;,

Additional details can be specified in the text.\r\rWhen a substance or product code is specified for the 'code' element, the \&quot;default\&quot; semantic context is that this is a positive statement of an allergy or intolerance (depending on the value of the 'type' element, if present) condition to the specified substance/product.  In the corresponding SNOMED CT allergy model, the specified substance/product is the target (destination) of the \&quot;Causative agent\&quot; relationship.\r\rThe 'substanceExposureRisk' extension is available as a structured and more flexible alternative to the 'code' element for making positive or negative allergy or intolerance statements.  This extension provides the capability to make \&quot;no known allergy\&quot; (or \&quot;no risk of adverse reaction\&quot;) statements regarding any coded substance/product (including cases when a pre-coordinated \&quot;no allergy to x\&quot; concept for that substance/product does not exist).

The 'code' element allows for the use of a specific substance or pharmaceutical product, or a group or class of substances. In the case of an allergy or intolerance to a class of substances, (for example, \&quot;penicillins\&quot;), the 'reaction.substance' element could be used to code the specific substance that was identifed as having caused the reaction (for example, \&quot;amoxycillin\&quot;). Duplication of the value in the 'code' and 'reaction.substance' elements is acceptable when a specific substance has been recorded in 'code'.&quot;,
