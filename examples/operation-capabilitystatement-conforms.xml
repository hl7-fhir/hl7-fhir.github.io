        <p>This operation asks the server to check that it implements all the resources, interactions, search parameters, and operations that the client provides in it&#39;s capability statement. The client provides both capability statements by reference, and must ensure that all the referenced resources are available to the conformance server</p>

        <p>The operation performs a full comparison of the functionality described by the two capability statements, including the profiles and value sets they reference, and also including concept maps and structure maps.</p>

        <p>The full execution of this operation is still a matter of research, but it is intended to support comparison of systems to see if they will interoperate</p>

        <p>If the capability statements can be successfully compared, then the return value is a 200 OK with an OperationOutcome along with intersection and union capability statements. The operation outcome can contain errors relating to differences between the capability statements. If the capability statements cannot be compared, because dependencies cannot be located, the return value is a 4xx error, with an OperationOutcome with at least one issue with severity &gt;= error</p>
